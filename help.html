<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>You probably see the square field with the turned square in it. </p>

<p >You can click there with the mouse and in the upper left corner there should<br>
appear a red dot. On the lower right corner there should appear a blue dot. </p>

<p >Click the <ins><strong>mirror</strong></ins> button in the menu line and you should have <br>
the whole thing mirrored or reflected with orange and green dots. </p>

<p >Well done, I am sure you got it. Click on the "<strong>generate</strong>" button to 
get the<br> tessellation tile. It is set to contours only by default. </p>

<p >After that you can get the SVG-code by clicking on the <strong>code</strong> button or the base64 dump<br> by clicking on the <strong>base64</strong> button. </p>

<p>Please find the rest out by yourself. I know you can do it , because you are awseome!</p>
